To setup the build environment you need to download the wireshark source, and fix all it's dependencies first.
Once you got that running you need to go to the plugins directory and copy the Custom.*.example files to Custom.*.
Replace every occurence of foo with nrf24.
To build you need to once rerun in toplevel:
  autogen.sh
  configure
  make
Once you're up and developing you just need to:
  make
The Binary will be put in plugins/nrf24/.libs/nrf24.so
